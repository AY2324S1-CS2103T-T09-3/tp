# MediLink Contacts

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* MediLink Contacts aims to help medical staff including nurses/doctors/pharmacists navigate through patient details in
  their high workload and time-pressured working environment. When medical emergencies arise, it becomes crucial to
  provide rapid access to emergency contacts for patients and access other details of the patients to make decisions
  more quickly. It is optimised for CLI so that users can quickly access the information.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the
  **[MedicLink Contacts Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t09-3.github.io/tp/)**.
